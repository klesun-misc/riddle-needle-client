The client part of my Unity multiplayer game - https://github.com/klesun/riddle-needle

All this client does is sending the input to the server and showing the image. The rendered image gets sent from server via web scokets, so there will not be any 3d on client (for now at least).

Client is also responsible for UI stuff like choosing a value from option list, text input, yes/no prompts, etc...
